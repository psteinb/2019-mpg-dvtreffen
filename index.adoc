=== Practical Programming Skills for Scientists

* taught 11 workshops since 2014
* 140 participants in total 
* positive feedback (average 4.75/5 stars overall)
* data and coding literacy increased
* fun experience to teach with methodical background

_how did we do that?_

== The carpentries

=== Carpentries?

[%step]
* teach foundational coding and data science skills to scientists https://carpentries.org/files/assessment/TheCarpentries2018AnnualReport.pdf[worldwide]
* coach/certify trainers in evidence-based teaching methods
* https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#biology-semester-long-course[share and evolve material] as open-source on github
* non-profit international organisation + 
(funding: 59% membership fees, 19% workshop fees, 22% donations)
* https://carpentries.org/members/[70+ members]: Cambridge U, Stanford U, EMBL/EBI, GFZ Potsdam, HZDR, University of Göttingen

=== Interactive and Engaging Workshops

[%step]
* 3 day in-presence workshops
* learning as a group (community building)
* continuous in-class feedback (sticky notes, etherpad)
* consider learners background (pre/post-workshop survey, learner profiles)
* affirmative self-assessment exercises during class

=== 3 day workshops

[.S-text]
____
How would you find a file on your computer's home directory that starts with a capital 'E' and is less than one Megabyte in size? 

. I have no idea how to do that.
. I would be able to do this with help by a colleaque or google.
. I use a cheatsheet for such things.
. No problem, I can do this blindly.

=== affirmative self-assessment exercises during class

[.S-text]
____
In our current directory, we want to find the 3 files which have the least number of lines. Which command listed below would work?

. ``wc -l * > sort -n > head -n 3``
. ``wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 1-3``
. ``wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n``
. ``wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 3``

=== Who can teach?

* officially managed workshops only by licensed instructors
* _instructor certification_:
** in-presence or remote 3 day workshop
** on-boarding (contribute to repo, participate in community activities)
** certification by _demo teaching_ and _demo feedback_

== Summary

=== Experiences

[%step]
* teaching is fun! +
(boosted by thriving community and open material)
* carpentries target domain scientists +
(boosting beginners in short time)
* cultural asymmetry:
** PIs: teaching often _not considered_ a value _worth paying for_
** much needed/appreciated by PhDs and PostDocs

=== Outlook

* (domain) _scientists need training_ in compute and data literacy
* _Carpentries_ can help with scalable, open and community-based training
* carpentry inspired https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/[HPC curriculum] incubating

_Thank you!_

== Appendix

=== Being A Carpentry Instructor

[%step]
* reduces time to prepare material  
(shared open-source materials)
* carpentry methods provide relyable teaching methods  
(self-confidence)
* feedback from co-teachers increases robustness  
(community based teaching)
* *career development* for young PhDs/PostDocs/...
